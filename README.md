terraria-server-linux
=====================

Run the Terraria server on Linux.


# Running

Everything is contained in a single shell script `start-terraria-server.sh`.
Executing it will result in a working Terraria server instance.

```
./start-terraria-server.sh
```

It is recommended to launch the server inside a `tmux` session.
